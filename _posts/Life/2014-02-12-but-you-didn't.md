*by* **Merrill Glass** 

Remember the time you lent me your car and I dented it? 

I thought you’d kill me…

But you didn’t.

<br>

Remember the time I forgot to tell you the dance was formal, and you came in jeans?

I thought you’d hate me…

But you didn’t.

<br>

Remember the times I’d flirt with other boys just to make you jealous, and you were?

I thought you’d drop me…

But you didn’t.

<br>

There were plenty of things you did to put up with me, to keep me happy, to love me, 

and there are so many things I wanted to tell you when you returned from Vietnam…

But you didn’t.
